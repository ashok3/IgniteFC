    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Why doesn't our calendar recognize celestial significant days that could unite the world.  Who has a vested interest in keeping us separate from nature?  Can our calendar ever change or is it written in stone until the end of time. Why would it be good for the future to reconnect to the natural cycle?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kelly said:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;textilish&quot;&gt;I guess I am too logical a person for this...but tell me why is it a fair analysis of topics? Because if someone joins early and spends all ten votes then new topics are added later would not be able to be voted on.  Geeze...I hate to be negative loser...but this voting process is bizarre...I guess I should be sharing this by clicking the facebook and twitter buttons...If anyone can help me by getting their friends to vote on this...I would appreciate it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Ron Zasadzinski suggested:&lt;br /&gt;You've all seen it - a crappy website, a restaurant menu that's hard to read, a brochure that makes you shake your head. Why oh why does this have to happen!? It doesn't, if you keep in mind a few basic design principles. If you lay out any of your own print or web content this information will help keep you out of the weeds. It'll help you figure out if your designer is worth what you are paying them too. (Hint - when they ask for a raise, say &amp;quot;yes&amp;quot;.)&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Jochen Wolters suggested:&lt;br /&gt;Being creative is tremendously satisfying: starting with a mere idea and working at it with dedication to make something that didn't exist before -- that is so much more rewarding than consuming what others make. All it takes to get started is setting aside a few minutes a day, every day.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title type="html">Are You A Highly Sensitive Person?</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Jaer suggested:&lt;br /&gt;Did you know that research shows that 15-20% of the population has an innate, genetic trait which is a more finely tuned nervous system ? Yes, our brains operate differently than 80% of the majority of the population allowing us to: process information more deeply; become easily overwhelmed by stimuli in our environment; and causes us to be more aware of subtleties?   This can be a curse or a blessing - depending upon how one learns to cope with this trait.  You might ask yourself the following questions:  Do you need more sleep than the average person?  Do you need more down time to process the events of your day?  Are you deeply intuitive and keenly perceptive?  Are you uniquely spiritual?  Do you have a rich, complex inner life?  Do you have vivid dreams?  If you answer yes, then you may be a Highly Sensitive Person (HSP.)   Learn more from a Licensed Professional counselor and HSP herself who has been organizing HSP Gathering Retreats, both locally, nationally and internationally since 2001,with Dr. Elaine Aron, author and research psychologist who has studied this trait and published several books. &lt;/p&gt;</content>
