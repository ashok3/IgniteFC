<p>The IgniteFC app will help you keep up to date with the Fort Collins
gathering of geeks, designers, and hipsters for a night of beer drinking
and fun.</p>
</p>
<p>This app was developed both to give a little back to the Ignite community, as well
as to experiment with various libraries and improve upon various coding methods and
it will hopefully be ported to Android and other mobile phones in order to learn
each platform better.</p>
<p>Thanks for downloading ;-P</p>
